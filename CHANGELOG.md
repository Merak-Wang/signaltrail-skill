# Changelog

## Unreleased

### 2026-09-08

- Added `signaltrail` as the preferred CLI, preserving the `daily-intel` entry point and
  existing Python, environment, and data identities.
- Split CLI dispatch into typed handlers grouped by responsibility; reorganized the mixed
  architecture/skill tests into subsystem tests and shared report fixtures.
- Rewrote both READMEs, shortened agent and architecture instructions, and consolidated
  documentation into usage, development, a single Draft roadmap, and retained history.
- Replaced README wording assertions with document-checker behavior tests. Documentation checks
  now cover images and exclude runtime/release snapshots; historical records no longer expire.
- Extended Chinese comment checks to nested packages and allowed concise input descriptions.
- Added the metered Hermes launcher, worker and auxiliary-call coverage, forced-summary session
  headers, independent evaluator tasks, and host-counter reconciliation. Unknown coverage remains
  explicit; end-to-end optimization acceptance is still qualified.
- Versioned evaluation dossiers to preserve old inputs and clarify within-section event ordering.

### Earlier changes

- Replaced the subjective repository scorecard with an evidence-based verification matrix, removed
  local development-session traces from public records, and added checks for personal Windows
  paths and Codex browser-session residue.
- Added a Draft roadmap for evidence-driven explainer scripts, independent claim/beat verification,
  deterministic story streams, licensed speech and subtitles, and reproducible news-explainer
  video with content, technical, and media-rights gates.
- Added the current schema 2.0 report gallery and responsive desktop/mobile previews, including
  explicit evidence, coverage, quality, external-image, and runtime limitations.
- Fixed documentation CI by moving the active narrative plan into the tracked execution-plan
  catalog; ignored local `plan.md` notes no longer satisfy repository link checks.
- Rebuilt the tracked `skills/signaltrail/` release snapshot from the package allowlist,
  synchronizing the harness-neutral procedure, runtime, schemas, engineering records,
  references, and public README.
- Clarified the harness-neutral authoring contract: any host that can run `daily-intel`, consume
  self-contained packets, and write their declared JSON outputs can drive the core pipeline;
  Hermes remains the first-party install/hook/delegation/Cron integration, built-in usage
  adapters remain limited to Hermes, Codex, and OpenClaw, and other hosts remain explicitly
  unmetered or provide a custom Python `UsageAdapter`. Automatic independent-evaluator
  scheduling is still Hermes-only.
- Added semantic Chinese logic/input/output docstrings to all 439 maintained Python functions and classes. Inputs name their provenance and consumed fields; outputs explain their downstream meaning. Critical safety/state/concurrency/compatibility decisions are documented inline and protected by an AST-based regression gate.
- Audited the repository for readability and determinism: centralized typed JSON-object reads and CLI JSON output, unified collision-safe atomic writers, made immutable JSON creation no-overwrite under concurrency, and injected the monitor clock in time-sensitive tests.
- Replaced the deleted developer Wiki/reading guide with a concise `AGENTS.md`, a top-level architecture map, indexed English engineering records, matching Chinese translations under `docs/zh-CN/`, a verification matrix, a technical-debt tracker, and mechanical documentation checks.
- Renamed the public Hermes skill and reader-facing report brand to **迹简情报台 · SignalTrail** (`signaltrail`) while retaining the `daily-intel` CLI, `daily_intelligence` package, report identifiers, legacy data root, and legacy `merak-brief`/`daily-intelligence` install-path discovery for backward compatibility.
- Reorganized `SKILL.md` to the Hermes/Agent Skills metadata layout, added a tracked-file-only community package builder, and documented an auditable GitHub publication workflow.
- Made Simplified Chinese the default repository README, added full English README and example documentation, and reframed the report gallery around product outcomes and operating scale.
- Filtered known placeholder image URLs during feed, page, and article extraction; added pixel-level rejection for uniform rasters, same-story fallback candidates, and cache-version invalidation so blank image cards are removed before publication.
- Moved story images below their headlines, using an image-and-summary layout on desktop and a stacked layout on narrow screens; updated both historical HTML examples without changing their report content.
- Added an explicit `zh-CN` / `en` output-language choice across run manifests, authoring packets, semantic caches, validation, Markdown, HTML, PDF, and Notion; cross-language semantic reuse is rejected.
- Simplified `SKILL.md`, removed checked-in runtime brief batches and a superseded dated audit, and moved the README preview into the stable `assets/readme/` tree.
- Updated the engineering records for the current zero-token monitor, deterministic clustering, schema 2.0 authoring sessions, foreground HTML/desktop delivery, background tail, media cache, recovery model, configuration, and test layout.
- Added automatic, atomic HTML delivery to the user's Desktop after each finalized edition, with absolute local media/archive/PDF links, an explicit directory override, and non-silent delivery errors.
- Shortened the edition critical path with pre-media semantic validation, real completion timestamps, non-duplicating stage history, resumable post-persistence projections, and per-stage save metrics.
- Added timed authoring sessions: each brief author submits one packet-assigned JSON result,
  Python validates and atomically merges batches, and the analysis author reads only an
  18-candidate packet; the full brief corpus stays outside that stage.
- Added bounded per-batch duration, API-call, input/output-token, model, and exit telemetry to the
  Hermes delegation integration, with optional queue/first-token/prefill/decode/cache fields when
  that host exposes them.
- Made HTML the foreground deliverable; PDF, optional Notion publishing and independent evaluation now run as an idempotent background tail with separate readiness milestones.
- Reserved the final 120 seconds for analysis and validation; incomplete brief batches can reduce coverage only after that deadline through run-owned targets, and schema 2.0 contexts reject legacy 1.5 publication.
- Added a persistent image URL cache with success TTLs, negative-cache retry windows, content-file verification, shared HTTP connection pooling, process-local DNS reuse, and bounded global/per-domain download concurrency.
- Changed full-text enrichment to bounded HTTP-first extraction with inert HTML parsing and existing-content reuse; Microsoft Edge now launches only for network failures or JavaScript shells that can benefit from browser rendering.
- Reused a valid fresh zero-token monitor snapshot before editions; stale or missing snapshots still trigger a network refresh across the configured sources.
- Generated bounded-scope brief authoring packets for each balanced batch and limited every brief
  author to packet data, one assigned draft write plus one submission command, no
  browsing/search/scripts, and at most one validation-only repair.
- Added a responsive, collapsible report table of contents with nested section links, current-position highlighting, remembered open state, mobile dismissal, and print exclusion while preserving the existing newspaper layout.
- Added a zero-model-token local monitor with bounded RSS/Atom parsing, conditional-request caches, declared-feed discovery, static-HTML fallback, explicit source health, and reusable snapshots for formal editions.
- Expanded discovery from 32 core sources to 83 configured sources without changing core report quotas, the 12-article full-text ceiling, or the model token budget.
- Added deterministic cross-source story clustering, stable story identities, lifecycle phases, and an importance score based on source tier, corroboration, recency, severity, and novelty.
- Added a localhost intelligence desk with vertical image-and-text news cards plus news-stream, story-cluster, source-health, and manual-verification views.
- Upgraded new reports to schema 2.0: three lenses now share one selected-event dossier and record causal chains, assumptions, evidence gaps, change from prior, decision relevance, and a required cross-perspective synthesis.
- Preserved report schemas 1.1–1.5 and the legacy source-index JSON shape for reads while keeping access failures distinct from `no_items`.
- Percent-encoded non-ASCII public image paths before schema validation and remote projection, preventing valid raster downloads with Unicode filenames from blocking report finalization.
- Added a bounded public-news image pipeline: capture card/Open Graph images, validate and store raster files locally by content hash, render vertical image-and-text stories, and upload local copies to resumable Notion image blocks with external fallback.
- Added fail-closed public-DNS confirmation for proxy fake-IP environments, continued past failed image candidates until the success budget is filled, allowed same-edition report revisions to retain their original event identities, and added idempotent in-place Notion image backfill for previously published text-only reports.
- Raised the default successful-image limit from 40 to 1000 while retaining the 8 MiB per-image, 80 MiB per-edition, raster-format, and pixel-count safety limits.
- Reworked the README as a concise capability overview and tied engineering records to current modules, states, commands, and tests.
- Expanded repository ignores for runtime artifacts, browser data, coverage output, editor state, and local build audits; removed the machine-specific build report from the public tree.
- Replaced real-looking media URLs in synthetic fixtures with reserved `.example` domains and documented the fixture boundary.
- Removed the unused `DAILY_INTEL_TIMEZONE` entry from `.env.example`; timezone remains configured through `sources.yaml` or `--timezone`.
- Displayed a timestamp for every report story: source publication time when available, otherwise an explicitly labeled collection time that does not affect `NEW` or freshness scoring.
- Made manual Edge verification opt-in so `run-edition` no longer opens or waits for the verification queue unless `--open-verification` is passed explicitly; `verify-pending` remains the recommended manual entry point.
- Declared `tzdata` as a runtime dependency so `ZoneInfo` works on Windows and minimal CI images without a system IANA time-zone database.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-07-18

- First stable release of the twice-daily Hermes intelligence workflow, with local-first delivery, resumable state, evidence boundaries, independent evaluation, and backward-compatible legacy index/schema reads.
- Reworked the GitHub README around a concise value proposition, quick start, output contract, architecture, operational boundaries, and links into the detailed Chinese Wiki.
- Added responsive, safely escaped local HTML reports and a chronological `reports/index.html` archive that work without Notion.
- Added A4 PDF projection from the same HTML through Microsoft Edge, with blocked network requests, page numbering, clickable links, and a ReportLab fallback.
- Made local JSON/Markdown/HTML/PDF delivery the default and kept `--publish` as the explicit opt-in for Notion only.
- Decoupled the independent evaluator from Notion: every successfully saved local report schedules evaluation, which refreshes the HTML/PDF assessment section without mutating the report JSON, Markdown, or content hash.
- Added a local feedback form that downloads JSON without uploading data, output configuration validation, PDF/HTML security and rendering tests, and updated the Chinese Wiki.

## 0.10.0 - 2026-07-17

- Locked every Hermes run to one canonical data root and rejected cross-root run, index, content, report, and evaluation artifacts with an explicit adoption command for migrations.
- Preserved successful enrichment IDs through finalization and added evidence binding checks for source mentions plus an explicit basis requirement for numeric scenarios.
- Added post-evaluation semantic brief reuse keyed by a content fingerprint; changed or poorly evaluated material now triggers re-authoring.
- Added bounded, no-script HTTP index prefetch with global/per-domain limits and sequential Edge fallback for login, challenge, JavaScript, and specialized adapters; rate-limited sources are not hammered again.
- Made the Edge verification frontend automatic for interactive runs and added `--unattended` for Cron/Gateway use. Publication still returns before the isolated evaluator runs.
- Added real phase durations and collection counts to run manifests, split verification out of the CLI, removed browser debug artifacts, and added cross-platform GitHub CI.

## 0.9.8 - 2026-07-17

- Added `run-edition --open-verification` so interactive Hermes Desktop runs automatically open the connected Edge verification frontend after collection when failed, challenged, or rate-limited pages exist.
- Reused the same verification-and-index-adoption implementation for automatic and manual `verify-pending` flows; no new runtime script was added.
- Kept scheduled Cron/Gateway runs non-interactive by requiring them to omit the new flag, and bounded the interactive default wait to 180 seconds.

## 0.9.7 - 2026-07-16

- Rejected the legacy metadata disclaimer “仅取得来源标题或公开元数据，正文尚未读取；请通过原文链接查看完整内容” and close variants when used as TL;DR text.
- Kept access boundaries in structured `source_ref.access` or internal evidence notes and out of reader-facing summaries.

## 0.9.6 - 2026-07-16

- Required one batch-mode Hermes `delegate_task` call so all three brief batches use model-authored translation and summarization; runtime scripts and string templates remain excluded.
- Made an empty or missing `brief_plan` trigger context refresh; manually inferred source targets are no longer accepted.
- Rejected `【外文】`/source prefixes, “see original link”, “source X reported”, and English abstracts disguised with a short Chinese prefix.
- Defined the TL;DR evidence hierarchy as fetched `content_path`, public description/abstract, then a strictly title-bounded Chinese restatement.
- Required one canonical runtime data directory per task to prevent manual and scheduled reports from splitting continuity state.

## 0.9.5 - 2026-07-16

- Added a machine-readable per-source `brief_plan` before authoring so three brief workers have deterministic coverage targets and exact default item IDs.
- Stopped the compiler from inventing missing briefs, Chinese translations, or TL;DR text; coverage gaps now produce one actionable error per source.
- Dropped unknown item IDs, moved misclassified briefs/events to their indexed sections, and made original source rank a deterministic non-blocking tie-breaker.
- Required schema 1.5 featured events to contain exactly one source article; corroborating articles remain separate events that analysis can cite together.

## 0.9.4 - 2026-07-16

- Preserved non-Chinese source headlines verbatim, added a separate Chinese `title_zh` line, and blocked `[英]` markers, headline-only summaries, workflow placeholders, and unread-body claims that contradict fetched content.
- Prioritized enriched items in authoring context and added three balanced source batches for parallel brief writing without duplicating candidate payloads.
- Rejected multiple articles from the same publisher inside one featured event and required cross-publisher references to corroborate the same event.
- Added a dedicated arXiv list adapter, low-information navigation filtering, Anthropic team-page and GitHub trending-navigation filters, and safer TWZ card/date/description extraction.
- Changed post-publication evaluation from a fragile one-shot job to three bounded asynchronous attempts for transient model/API connection failures.

## 0.9.3 - 2026-07-15

- Added an exact model-authoring draft contract with canonical section IDs, complete analysis fields, and a mandatory fast `validate-report` step before finalization.
- Normalized legacy section mappings and aliases without silently dropping their content.
- Fixed cross-source featured events so the primary source only has to match the first evidence reference.
- Linked featured events to matching briefs across sections, appended deterministic metadata-only disclosures, and ignored brief-only analysis references with actionable warnings.

## 0.9.2 - 2026-07-15

- Rebuilt the verification page as a full-height flex layout with a dedicated always-scrollable source list, wide scrollbar, compact header, and explicit total/processed counts.
- Added typed `rate_limited` source status for HTTP 429 and temporary-access messages such as Reuters restrictions; interactive verification now stops retrying those pages and retains their links for a later edition.

## 0.9.1 - 2026-07-15

- Changed Hugging Face Papers to the stable `https://huggingface.co/papers` page and transparently rewrote legacy `/papers/month` verification links.
- Upgraded the Edge verification queue into a collector-aware local frontend with connected/offline state and per-source waiting, verification, captured, and extraction-failure feedback.

## 0.9.0 - 2026-07-15

- Filled per-source coverage targets without an importance cutoff while preserving original source rank and allowing previously unreported older items.
- Added a deterministic report compiler for IDs, source snapshots, counts, score breakdowns, freshness status, confidence caps, and pending-source links.
- Split judgement into independent geopolitical, AI research/development, and stock-analysis sections.
- Hid numeric importance and content-access labels from reader-facing Markdown and Notion while retaining them in the local JSON truth.
- Reworked Edge verification into one failed-link queue that captures structured items from user-opened authenticated tabs and prepares a report revision.
- Automatically scheduled a hash-bound one-shot independent evaluation after successful publication, removing evaluator latency from the generation path.
- Increased default source coverage, retained the 15-item hard cap, and kept full-text enrichment limited to at most 12 analysis-critical items with bounded concurrency.

## 0.8.1 - 2026-07-14

- Reduced the per-edition full-text hard cap from 40 to 12 and preserved caller order as enrichment priority.
- Reworked full-text extraction to use bounded async browser pages: three globally by default and one per domain.
- Capped schema 1.5 featured events at 12; ordinary stories remain lightweight briefs and are not analyzed item by item.
- Recorded enrichment request, acceptance, cap, and concurrency settings in the run manifest.

## 0.8.0 - 2026-07-14

- Added schema 1.5 with lightweight `briefs[]` for broad coverage and selected `items[]` for evidence-heavy continuity and judgement.
- Added configurable per-source report targets, retained the hard 15-item cap, and balanced multi-page source merging so later sections are not starved.
- Added generic publication-date extraction and made missing/stale dates block `NEW` in schema 1.5.
- Added deterministic report normalization, explicit source metrics, and strict report/index URL, title, source, and access identity checks.
- Made full-text selection cumulative and batch-oriented across repeated enrich calls.
- Moved independent evaluation after publication into hash-bound immutable evaluation artifacts with retryable Notion append.
- Delayed long-term continuity-state updates until independent evaluation while allowing the report itself to publish immediately.
- Updated Hermes procedures, report contract, runbook, system design, README, and Chinese Repo Wiki for the new workflow.

## 0.7.0 - 2026-07-14

- Added schema 1.4 source-grouped rendering with a strict 15-item per-source cap.
- Added multi-page source exploration, Guardian UK coverage, persistent same-domain dynamic pages, and the Papers with Code successor route.
- Made visible Edge verification capture successful authenticated pages immediately while preserving failed links.
- Added compact budgeted context, history-contamination controls, and Notion user-feedback ingestion.
- Added multi-perspective narrative judgement and a separate nine-dimension evaluation contract.
- Upgraded Markdown and Notion layouts with source headings, numbered items, callouts, toggles, tables, and optional public images.
- Removed obsolete run wrappers, duplicate legacy design documents, and unused revision-copy code.
- Fixed stable wheel installs so the CLI locates configs and schemas from the active Hermes skill directory.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-07-14

- Fixed the published hierarchy to 资讯、技术、研判 with seven always-present subsections.
- Added schema 1.3 judgement coverage and evening change/next-day-watch validation.
- Moved market sources to `information.market` and technical news to `technology.news`.
- Made Microsoft Edge the native Windows default with a dedicated persistent login profile.
- Strengthened on-demand body loading and metadata-only disclosure rules.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-07-13

- Added `information.technology` while retaining technical-community news under `technology.news`.
- Made interactive verification visible and non-interactive-terminal safe with automatic timeout.
- Added publication-age freshness caps and continuity-aware `NEW` validation.

- Added immutable index, context, content, report, and state-history revisions.
- Added run state machine with locks and prepare/enrich/finalize workflow.
- Added complete JSON/Markdown persistence and continuity state updates.
- Added explainable importance scoring and stronger evidence validation.

- Added Hermes-compatible `SKILL.md` with progressive-disclosure references.
- Added Playwright source collection, challenge detection, and dedicated persistent profile support.
- Added legacy JSON importer and source-specific article filters.
- Added on-demand article-body extraction and compact continuity bundles.
- Added structured report contract, validator, and Notion publisher.
- Added unit tests and sample inputs.
